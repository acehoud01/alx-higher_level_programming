# 0x0A Python Inheritance

## Overview

This repository contains Python code demonstrating the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming. Inheritance is a key feature of object-oriented programming languages like Python, allowing classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes.

## Contents

- `1-my_list.py`: Example code demonstrating a simple class `MyList` inheriting from the built-in `list` class.
- `2-is_same_class.py`: Example code showing how to determine if an object is an instance of a specific class.
- `3-is_kind_of_class.py`: Example code illustrating how to check if an object is an instance of a class or an instance of a class that inherited from a specific class.
- `4-inherits_from.py`: Example code demonstrating how to check if an object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from a specific class.
- `5-base_geometry.py`: Example code showcasing inheritance with a base class `BaseGeometry`.
- `6-base_geometry.py`: Example code extending the base class `BaseGeometry` with additional functionality.
- `7-base_geometry.py`: Example code adding validation to the methods of `BaseGeometry`.
- `8-rectangle.py`: Example code implementing a subclass `Rectangle` inheriting from `BaseGeometry`.
- `9-rectangle.py`: Example code extending the `Rectangle` class with additional functionality.
- `10-square.py`: Example code implementing a subclass `Square` inheriting from `Rectangle`.
- `100-my_int.py`: Example code showcasing how to override a magic method for custom behavior.
- `101-add_attribute.py`: Example code illustrating how to add attributes dynamically to an instance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

To run the examples, simply execute the Python files with a Python interpreter:

```bash
python3 <filename>.py
