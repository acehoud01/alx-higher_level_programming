0x01 Python - If/Else, Loops, Functions

Description
This project is part of the ALX School curriculum for the Higher-level programming track. 
It aims to introduce the fundamentals of Python programming, focusing on conditional statements 
(if, else, elif), loops (for, while), and functions.

Through a series of tasks, learners will gain hands-on experience with Python's control structures and 
understand how to manipulate data using loops and functions. 
This project also covers the importance of indentation in Python and how to define and use functions to organize and reuse code.
