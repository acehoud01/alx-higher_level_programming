0x07-Python-Test_Driven_Development
Welcome to "0x07-Python-Test_Driven_Development," an educational journey emphasizing the importance and practices of Test-Driven Development (TDD) within the Python programming environment. This project is designed for learners who wish to adopt a disciplined approach to writing clean, effective, and bug-resistant code. Through a series of guided exercises and challenges, participants will learn the fundamentals of TDD, including writing tests, interpreting test results, and refactoring code.

Objectives
Understand the principles and benefits of Test-Driven Development.
Learn to write comprehensive test cases using Python's unittest framework.
Develop Python code by writing tests first and then implementing functionality to pass the tests.
Practice refactoring code with the safety net of tests.
Explore advanced testing features and scenarios in Python.
