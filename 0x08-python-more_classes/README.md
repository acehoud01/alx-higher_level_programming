0x08 Python - More Classes
Overview
This project dives deeper into the concepts of classes in Python, exploring more advanced features and use cases. The aim is to provide a thorough understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python, focusing on more complex aspects of classes and objects. Through this module, learners will grasp how to effectively utilize classes in Python to build more sophisticated and robust applications.

Learning Objectives
Understand and apply the principles of classes and instances in Python.
Learn how to use the __init__, __str__, and __repr__ methods for class definitions.
Explore the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Implement various types of methods within a class: instance methods, class methods, static methods.
Delve into more advanced topics such as decorators, property attributes, setter/getter methods, and name mangling for privacy.
Develop an understanding of how classes can interact with each other through relationships like association, aggregation, and composition.
Requirements
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Files and Descriptions
Below is a list of files contained in this project, along with a brief description of each:

0-rectangle.py - Defines an empty class Rectangle that represents a rectangle.
1-rectangle.py - Enhances the Rectangle class with width and height private instance attributes.
2-rectangle.py - Adds area and perimeter methods to the Rectangle class.
3-rectangle.py - Implements the __str__ method to enable printing the rectangle using the print() function.
4-rectangle.py - Implements the __repr__ method to support the reproduction of instances based on their string representation.
5-rectangle.py - Adds a destructor method to Rectangle to announce when an instance is deleted.
6-rectangle.py - Incorporates a class variable to count instances of Rectangle.
7-rectangle.py - Introduces a class attribute that changes the symbol used for string representation.
8-rectangle.py - Adds a static method to compare and return the bigger rectangle based on the area.
9-rectangle.py - Expands the Rectangle class with a class method that returns a new Rectangle instance as a square.
