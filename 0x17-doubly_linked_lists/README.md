0x17-Doubly Linked Lists
Project Overview
This project is an exploration into the implementation, manipulation, and application of doubly linked lists in programming. Unlike singly linked lists, each node in a doubly linked list contains a reference to the next node and the previous one, offering more flexibility in navigation.

Objectives
To understand the concept and structure of doubly linked lists.
To learn how to implement basic operations on doubly linked lists, including insertion, deletion, and traversal.
To appreciate the advantages of doubly linked lists over singly linked lists.
To implement advanced algorithms using doubly linked lists, enhancing problem-solving skills.
Requirements
Programming language: Ensure you have a working knowledge of C, as the examples and exercises are implemented in this language.
Environment: A Linux terminal or equivalent command line interface.
Compiler: gcc with support for -std=gnu89 flag (GCC version 4.8.4 or later recommended).
Style guidelines: All C files must adhere to Betty style and documentation.Z
